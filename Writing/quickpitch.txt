Hi! My name is Neil Movva, and today I want to show you Project Pathfinder, which is this glove I'm wearing right here. What pathfinder does is simple: it measures distances to nearby objects and translates this data into gentle pulses that I feel on my fingertip. Closer objects are represented by fast, urgent taps, while distant objects are slow and steady, like a heartbeat. With some practice, the glove lets me point to objects and get a feel for how far or close they are. It lets me scan my surroundings with a sweep of my hand. The goal is to give the visually impaired a new way of navigating environments, one that doesn't require physical contact and operates at longer ranges. Let's talk about how it works.
