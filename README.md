Pathfinder is a glove that translates distance into haptic feedback. Users just wear the glove and point at objects up to 500 centimeters away, and feel gentle pulses at their fingertips corresponding to the object's distance. Itâ€™s designed to give the user greater freedom of motion and longer operational range when compared to traditional navigation solutions for the blind, such as the cane. I incorporated research ranging from embedded electronics to the neuroscience of touch to turn this simple concept into the best prototype I could, before sharing the device with my local community center for the blind.
